# cereebro

## Mission statement

The goal of project cereebro is to automate the documentation of applications' dependencies in a distributed system.

## Why

The name is inspired by the [X-Men's Cerebro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebro) device, which allows its user to locate mutants accross the world.

We named it cere**e**bro because : 

 * cerebro.io wasn't available
 * no legal issues
 * [that's the way americans pronounce cerebro anyway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFyYvdvUEqo)

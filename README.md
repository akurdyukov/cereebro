# cereebro

## Mission statement

The goal of project cereebro is to automate the documentation of applications' dependencies in a distributed system.

## Why

The name is inspired by the [X-Men's Cerebro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebro) device, which allows its user to locate mutants accross the world.

We named it cere**e**bro because : 

 * cerebro.io wasn't available
 * no legal issues
 * [that's the way americans pronounce cerebro anyway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFyYvdvUEqo)
 
## Continuous Integration

 * [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/cereebro/cereebro)
 * [SONAR](https://sonarqube.com/dashboard?id=io.cereebro%3Acereebro)

## Code Conventions

Java :
 
  * eclipse formatter : "Java conventions with spaces" (I don't know about IntelliJ)
  * line width : 120
  * indent using spaces only
  * auto-format all the things
  * Use off/on tags to keep the formatter off sections that need specific formatting (like builders)

XML :

  * indent using 4 spaces
  * line width : 120

# Cereebro

The goal of Cereebro is to automate the documentation of relationships between components in a distributed system.

## Why

When building a distributed system, it quickly becomes hard to keep track of every component and its dependencies.    
Writing architecture documents and drawing diagrams is cool, but these pieces of art eventually get obsolete after a few time. Keeping software documentation up-to-date is an ageless problem.  
Project Cereebro answers it by generating a map of a system at runtime : 

 * by simply adding a Cereebro Snitch Spring Boot starter, the context of each application is analyzed to detect its  relationships with other components, providing a fragment of the whole system
 * the Cereebro server resolves the fragments from every Snitch to reconstitute the big picture  

The name Cereebro is inspired by the [X-Men's Cerebro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebro) device, which allows its user to locate mutants accross the world.

We named it cere**e**bro because : 

 * cerebro.io wasn't available
 * no legal issues with Marvel comics
 * [that's the way americans pronounce cerebro anyway](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EFyYvdvUEqo)
 
## Getting Started

Get started with [Cereebro, Spring Cloud Netflix and the Eureka Server](https://github.com/cereebro/cereebro/wiki/Using-Cereebro-with-Spring-Cloud-Netflix-and-the-Eureka-Server).

Learn more in the [project documentation](https://github.com/cereebro/cereebro/wiki).

Check out our [samples and see them running on Heroku](https://github.com/cereebro/cereebro-samples).
 
## Continuous Integration

 * [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/cereebro/cereebro)
 * [SONAR](https://sonarqube.com/dashboard?id=io.cereebro%3Acereebro)

## Code Conventions

Java :
 
  * eclipse formatter : "Java conventions with spaces" (I don't know about IntelliJ)
  * line width : 120
  * indent using spaces only
  * auto-format all the things
  * Use off/on tags to keep the formatter off sections that need specific formatting (like builders)
  * test all the things

XML :

  * indent using 4 spaces
  * line width : 120
